    	<p>At age 14, Easton LaChappelle met a 7-year-old girl who had a prosthetic arm. The limb could only open and close, and yet it cost $80,000. He thought he could do better, and do it for under $1,000. He set to work in his bedroom, and later the family garage. 3D printing of prosthetic arms became an affordable reality.</p>
    <p>In less than 3 years, he was making a prototype limb for under $500 that was actually interfacing with the nervous system of its owner.</p>
    <p>What’s more, he is only doing this to make the world a better place! He could have made millions on his discoveries thus far, but instead, he releases all his intellectual property to the world by making them open sourced!</p>
